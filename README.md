My varied solutions to the problems listed on https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Main_Page 

If you are not familiar, hdlbits is a site full of digital circuit design exercises using Verilog, created by Henry Wong.
I believe it is a great way to practise and familiarize oneself with digital design fundamentals!

My solutions range from trying to achieve optimal outcomes, using odd methods, and brute force to pass the exercises.

Thanks for reading!
